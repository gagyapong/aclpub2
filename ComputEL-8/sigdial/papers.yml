- abstract: This paper presents a set of linguistic resources that formalizes the morphological 
    behavior of simple Rromani adjectives. We describe the formalization of the adjectives’ morphology 
    and the implementation with the NooJ linguistic platform of an electronic dictionary associated 
    with a formal morpho-syntactic grammar. We can then apply this set of resources to a corpus to evaluate 
    the resources and automatically annotate adjectival forms in Rromani texts. The final set of resources 
    can then be used to identify each Rromani dialectal variant and can be used as a pedagogical tool to teach
    Rromani as a second language.

  title: 'From Data Collection to Usable Corpus: The Development of the isiZulu National
    Corpus'
- abstract: Parallel sentence mining is crucial for down-
    stream tasks such as Machine Translation, especially for low-resource languages, where such
    resources are scarce. In this context, we apply a pipeline approach with contextual embeddings
    on two endangered Slavic languages spoken in Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian, to evaluate mining 
    quality. To this end, we compare off-the-shelf multilingual language models and
    word encoders pre-trained on Upper Sorbian to understand their impact on sentence mining.
    Moreover, to filter out irrelevant pairs, we experiment with a post-processing of mined sentences
    through an unsupervised word aligner based on word embeddings. We observe the
    usefulness of additional pre-training in Upper Sorbian, which leads to direct improvements
    when mining the same language but also its related language, Lower Sorbian.

  title: 'Bilingual Sentence Mining for Low-Resource Languages: a Case Study on Upper
    and Lower Sorbian'
- abstract: Many endangered, under-represented, minority and
    Indigenous language communities around the
    world need access to multilingual online resources
    to survive in the digital age. The Living
    Dictionaries platform provides a collaborative
    online space for professional linguists and citizen-linguists alike to produce their own grassroots
    digital dictionaries that include multimedia such as
    audio recordings and images. These online lexica
    can play an important role in assisting present and
    future generations in combatting language loss and
    creating visibility for their languages and cultures
    on the Internet.

  title: 'Citizen linguists and decolonial lexicography: Co-creative dictionary-building
    in grassroots digital language documentation'
- abstract: The SENCOTEN language, spoken on the Saanich peninsula of southern Vancouver Island, 
    is in the midst of vigorous language revitalization efforts to turn the tide of language
    loss as a result of colonial language policies. To support these on-the-ground efforts, the community is turning to digital technology. 
    Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology holds great promise for accelerating language
    documentation and the creation of educational resources. However, developing ASR systems for SENCOTEN is challenging 
    due to limited data and significant vocabulary variation from its polysynthetic structure and stress-driven metathesis. To address these challenges, we
    propose an ASR-driven documentation pipeline that leverages augmented speech data from a
    text-to-speech (TTS) system and cross-lingual transfer learning with Speech Foundation Models (SFMs).
    An n-gram language model is also incorporated via shallow fusion or n-best restoring to maximize
    the use of available data. Experiments on the SENCOTEN dataset show aword error rate (WER) of 19.34% and a 
    character error rate (CER) of 5.09% on the test set with a 57.02% out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
    rate. After filtering minor cedilla-related errors,WER improves to 14.32% (26.48% on unseen
    words) and CER to 3.45%, demonstrating the potential of our ASR-driven pipeline to support SENCOTEN language documentation.

  title: Supporting SENĆOŦEN Language Documentation Efforts with Automatic Speech
    Recognition
- abstract: We use 40-year-old digitalised tape-recorded fieldwork data in Haitian Creole to train a native self-supervised learning (SSL) model of speech representation (WAV2VEC2). We also
    use a continued pre-training approach on pre-trained SSL models of two foreign languages:
    the lexifier language – French – and an unrelated language – English. We compare the
    performances of these three SSL models, and of two other foreign SSL models directly finetuned, on an ASR task, where all five models are fine-tuned on transcribed fieldwork recordings in Haitian Creole. Our results show the best-performing model is the one trained using a continued pre-training approach on the lexifier language, followed by the native model.
    We conclude that the ‘mobilising the archive’-approach advocated by (Bird, 2020) is a promising way forward to design speech technologies for new languages.

  title: 'Speech Technologies with Fieldwork Recordings: the Case of Haitian Creole'
- abstract: This paper reports methods and results from a participatory design workshop aimed at evaluating the use of speech synthesis and text-to-speech for Ojibwe language education. Using
    an existing text-to-speech feature as a starting point, we worked with two groups of Ojibwe
    language instructors using a guided trial of the speech synthesis system and a two hour semistructured workshop with the aim of creating a lesson plan that utilizes text-to-speech. We
    highlight the insights from this work, both in how to design and deliver speech synthesis systems for Indigenous language education, but also how to approach and design such a workshop to ensure a fruitful discourse.

  title: 'Evaluating Indigenous language speech synthesis for education: A participatory
    design workshop on Ojibwe text-to-speech'
- abstract: Approximate search is a valuable component of online dictionaries for
    learners, allowing them to find words even when they have not fully mastered the
    orthography or cannot reliably perceive phonemic differences in the language.
    However, evaluating the performance of different approximate search algorithms
    remains difficult in the absence of real user queries. We detail several methods
    for generating synthetic queries representing various user personas. We then compare
    the performance of several search algorithms on both real and synthetic queries
    in two Indigenous languages, SENĆOŦEN and Michif, that are phonologically and
    morphologically very different from English.

  title: User-friendly technology distribution and the language technology development

- abstract: This paper addresses the problem of data
    interchange involving SIL FLEx, a software widely used for morphological
    glossing of texts in underresourced languages. Interlinear glossed texts (IGT)
    created in FLEx can be exported in a well defined XML format. However, IGT
    created in other programs (e.g. Toolbox or
    ELAN) or even in another version of the same FLEx project cannot be imported,
    which blocks the reuse of legacy data as well as roundtrips involving FLEx. We
    present a solution using Python and XSLT which was successfully used to merge a
    large collection of legacy texts in Forest and Tundra Enets (formerly glossed in Toolbox)
    with an existing FLEx project.

  title: Importing complete interlinear glossed texts into SIL FLEx
- abstract: Rule-based grammatical error correction has
    long been seen as the most effective way to
    create user-friendly end-user systems for gram-
    matical error correction (GEC). However, in
    the recent years the large language models and
    generative AI systems based on that technol-
    ogy have been progressed fast to challenge the
    traditional GEC approach. In this article we
    show which possibilities and limitations this
    approach bears for Indigenous languages that
    have more limited digital presence in the large
    language model data and a different literacy
    background than English. We show experi-
    ments in North Sámi, an Indigenous language
    of Northern Europe.

  title: Exploring Limitations and Risks of LLM-Based Grammatical Error Correction
    for Indigenous Languages
- abstract: The expansion of the speech technology sector has given rise to a novel
    economic model in language research, with the objective of developing speech datasets.
    This model is expanding to under-served African languages through collaborative
    efforts between industries, organisations, and the active participation of communities.
    This collaboration is yielding new datasets for machine learning, while also disclosing
    vulnerabilities and sociolinguistic discrepancies between industrialised and non-industrialised
    societies. A case study of a speech data collection camp that took place in September
    2024 in Cameroon, involving representatives of 31 languages throughout the continent,
    illustrates both the prospects of the new economic model for research on under-served
    languages and the challenges of fair, effective, and responsible participation.

  title: 'Multilingual MFA: Forced Alignment on Low-Resource Related Languages'
- abstract: In this paper, we discuss the development of a long-term partnership between community and university-based language workers
    to create supportive language technologies for Tsuutina, a critically endangered Dene language spoken in southern
    Alberta, Canada. Initial development activities in this partnership sought to rapidly integrate existing language materials, with the aim of 
    arriving at tools that would be effective and impactful for community use by virtue of their extensive lexical coverage. We describe how,
    as this partnership developed, this approach was gradually superseded by one that involved a more targeted,
    lexical-item-by-lexical-item review process that was directly informed by other community language priorities and connected to the work a local language authority. 
    We describe how this shift in processes correlated with other changes in local language programs and priorities, 
    noting how ongoing communication allowed this partnership to adapt to the evolving needs of local organizations.

  title: Creating an intelligent dictionary of Tsuut’ina one verb at a time
- abstract: It is by now common knowledge in the NLP
    community that low-resource languages need
    large-scale data creation efforts and novel con-
    tributions in the form of robust algorithms that
    work in data-scarce settings. Amongst these
    languages, however, many have a large amount
    of data, ripe for NLP applications, except that
    this data exists in image-based formats. This
    includes scanned copies of extremely valuable
    dictionaries, linguistic field notes, children’s
    stories, plays, and other textual material. To
    extract the text data from these non machine-
    readable images, Optical Character Recogni-
    tion (OCR) is the most popular technique, but
    it has proven to be challenging for low-resource
    languages because of their unique properties
    (uncommon diacritics, rare words etc.) and due
    to a general lack of preserved page-structure in
    the OCR output. So, to contribute to the reduc-
    tion of these two big bottlenecks (lack of text
    data and layout quality), we release the first
    textual and structural OCR dataset for 8 indige-
    nous languages of Latin America. We hope that
    our dataset will encourage researchers within
    the NLP and Computational Linguistics com-
    munities to work with these languages.

  title: 'AILLA-OCR: A First Textual and Structural Post-OCR Dataset for 8 Indigenous
    Languages of Latin America'
- abstract: One of the greatest issues facing documentary
    linguists is the transcription bottleneck. While
    the large quantity of audio and video data gener-
    ated as part of a documentary project serves as
    a long-lasting record of the language, without
    corresponding text transcriptions, it remains
    largely inaccessible for revitalization efforts
    and linguistic analysis. Automated Speech
    Recognition (ASR) is frequently proposed as
    the solution to this problem. However, two is-
    sues often prevent documentary linguists from
    making use of ASR models: 1) the thought that
    the typical documentary project does not have
    sufficient data to develop an adequate ASR
    model and 2) that correcting the output of an
    ASR model would be more time-consuming for
    transcribers than simply creating a transcription
    from scratch. In this paper, we tackle both of
    these issues by developing an ASR model in
    the larger context of a documentation project
    for Nasal, a low-resource language of western
    Indonesia. Fine-tuning a larger pre-trained lan-
    guage model on 25 hours of transcribed Nasal
    speech, we produce a model that has a 44%
    word error rate. Despite this relatively high
    error rate, tests comparing speed of transcrib-
    ing from scratch and correcting ASR-generated
    transcripts show that the ASR model can sig-
    nificantly speed up the transcription process.

- abstract: Kwak’wala is an Indigenous language spoken
    in British Columbia, with a rich legacy of pub-
    lished documentation spanning more than a
    century, and an active community of speakers,
    teachers, and learners engaged in language revi-
    talization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts
    created during the collaboration between Franz
    Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but
    remain unreadable by machines. Complete dig-
    itization through optical character recognition
    has the potential to facilitate transliteration into
    modern orthographies and the creation of other
    language technologies. In this paper, we ap-
    ply the latest OCR techniques to a series of
    Kwak’wala texts only accessible as images, and
    discuss the challenges and unique adaptations
    necessary to make such technologies work for
    these real-world texts. Building on previous
    methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-
    shelf OCR methods, language identification,
    and masking to effectively isolate Kwak’wala
    text, along with post-correction models, to pro-
    duce a final high-quality transcription.

  title: Adaptability of NLP Annotation Tools for Linguistics
- abstract: This paper describes the process and learn-
    ing outcomes of a three-day workshop on ma-
    chine learning basics for documentary linguists.
    During this workshop, two groups of linguists
    working with two Indigenous languages of
    North America, Blackfoot and Dënë Su ˛łıné,
    became acquainted with machine learning prin-
    ciples, explored how machine learning can be
    used in data processing for under-resourced
    languages and then applied different machine
    learning methods for automatic morphologi-
    cal interlinearization and parts-of-speech tag-
    ging. As a result, participants discovered paths
    to greater collaboration between computer sci-
    ence and documentary linguistics and reflected
    on how linguists might be enabled to apply ma-
    chine learning with less dependence on experts.

  title: 'AI for Interlinearization and POS-tagging: Teaching Linguists to Fish'
- abstract: This paper presents the creation of a Universal
    Dependency (UD) treebank for Amahuaca (Peru),
    marking the first UD treebank within the Headwaters
    subbranch of the Panoan family, spoken mostly in Peru
    and Brazil. While the UD guidelines provided a general
    framework for our annotations, language-specific
    decisions were necessary due to the rich morphology
    of the Amahuaca language. The paper also describes
    specific constructions to initiate a discussion on several
    general UD annotation guidelines, particularly those
    concerning clitics and morpheme-level dependencies.

  title: Developing a toolkit for community-led language documentation and reclamation
    in Akuzipik
- abstract: 'This paper explores finetuning Whisper for transcribing audio from linguistic
    elicitation of Tira, a Heiban language of Sudan. Audio originates from linguistic fieldwork and is bilingual in English and Tira.
    We finetune Whisper large-v3 using hand-labeled Tira audio and evaluate the resulting
    model on bilingual audio.
    We show that Whisper exhibits catastrophic forgetting of English after only a
    small amount of training, but that including automatically annotated English spans
    of audio in the training data dramatically reduces catastrophic forgetting of
    English while largely preserving ASR performance on monolingual Tira audio.
    This work is relevant to the study of automatic speech recognition for under-resourced
    languages and for contexts of bilingualism in a high and low-resourced language.'

  title: Data augmentation for low-resource bilingual ASR from Tira linguistic elicitation
    using Whisper
- abstract: Machine translation (MT) can be a useful technology for language documentation
    and for promoting language use in endangered language communities. Few endangered
    languages, however, have an existing parallel corpus large enough to train a reasonable
    MT model. In this paper, we re-purpose a wide range of diverse data sources containing
    Amis, English, and Mandarin text to serve as parallel corpora for training MT
    systems for Amis, one of the Indigenous languages of Taiwan. To supplement the
    small amount of Amis-English data, we produce synthetic Amis-English data by using
    a high quality MT system to generate English translations for the Mandarin side
    of the Amis-Mandarin corpus. Using two popular neural MT systems, OpenNMT and
    NLLB, we train models to translate between English and Amis, and Mandarin and
    Amis. We find that including synthetic data is helpful only when translating to
    English. In addition, we observe that neither MT architecture is consistently
    superior to other and that performance seems to vary according to the direction
    of translation and the amount of data used. These results indicate that MT is
    possible for an under-resourced language even without a formally prepared parallel
    corpus, but multiple training methods should be explored to produce optimal results.

  title: Integrating diverse corpora for training an endangered language machine translation
    system
- abstract: How is automated tone transcription affected
    by the choice of transcription orthography? In
    this paper we present a range of experiments
    that indicate that, even when the tonal repre-
    sentations are kept the same, the way vowels
    and consonants are transcribed can affect tonal
    character outputs. Our results also indicate that
    using a Language Model (LM) for decoding
    can mitigate problems with tonal outputs, but
    tones remain the most difficult part of the tran-
    scription. In doing this we also present the first
    Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models
    for the Baima language, spoken in Sichuan and
    Gansu, China. We hope to use these models to
    contribute to ongoing documentation efforts.

  title: 'Kuene: A Web Platform for Facilitating Hawaiian Word Neologism'
- abstract: Building downstream NLP applications with
    tokenization systems built on morphological
    segmentation has been shown to be fruitful for
    certain morphologically-rich languages. Yet,
    indigenous and endangered languages, which
    tend to be highly polysynthetic, thereby a po-
    tential beneficiary of this approach, pose ad-
    ditional difficulties in their limited access to
    annotated data for morphological segmenta-
    tion tasks. In this study, we develop mor-
    phological segmentation models for Hupa, a
    Dene/Athabaskan language critically endan-
    gered to North America. With a total of 595
    word types, we seek to identify an optimal mor-
    phological segmentation model and illustrate
    how those tested perform under different levels
    of training data limitation. We propose a simple
    method that casts morphological segmentation
    as a sequence binary classification task. While
    this approach does not outperform the estab-
    lished practice of multi-class classification, it
    outperforms neural alternatives. This work is
    conducted under the intention to act as a start-
    ing point for future technological developments
    with Hupa looking to leverage its morpholog-
    ical qualities, which we hope can serve as a
    reflection for work with other indigenous lan-
    guages being studied under similar constraints.
