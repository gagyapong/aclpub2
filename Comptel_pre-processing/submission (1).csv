information retrieval",oral,"Approximate search is a valuable component of online dictionaries for learners, allowing them to find words even when they have not fully mastered the orthography or cannot reliably perceive phonemic differences in the language. However, evaluating the performance of different approximate search algorithms remains difficult in the absence of real user queries. We detail several methods for generating synthetic queries representing various user personas. We then compare the performance of several search algorithms on both real and synthetic queries in two Indigenous languages, SENĆOŦEN and Michif, that are phonologically and morphologically very different from English."

equity",oral,"The expansion of the speech technology sector has given rise to a novel economic model in language research, with the objective of developing speech datasets. This model is expanding to under-served African languages through collaborative efforts between industries, organisations, and the active participation of communities. This collaboration is yielding new datasets for machine learning, while also disclosing vulnerabilities and sociolinguistic discrepancies between industrialised and non-industrialised societies. A case study of a speech data collection camp that took place in September 2024 in Cameroon, involving representatives of 31 languages throughout the continent, illustrates both the prospects of the new economic model for research on under-served languages and the challenges of fair, effective, and responsible participation."

language-documentation",oral,"This paper explores finetuning Whisper for transcribing audio from linguistic elicitation of Tira, a Heiban language of Sudan.
Audio originates from linguistic fieldwork and is bilingual in English and Tira.
We finetune Whisper large-v3 using hand-labeled Tira audio and evaluate the resulting model on bilingual audio.
We show that Whisper exhibits catastrophic forgetting of English after only a small amount of training, but that including automatically annotated English spans of audio in the training data dramatically reduces catastrophic forgetting of English while largely preserving ASR performance on monolingual Tira audio.
This work is relevant to the study of automatic speech recognition for under-resourced languages and for contexts of bilingualism in a high and low-resourced language."

language documentation",oral,"Machine translation (MT) can be a useful technology for language documentation and for promoting language use in endangered language communities. Few endangered languages, however, have an existing parallel corpus large enough to train a reasonable MT model. In this paper, we re-purpose a wide range of diverse data sources containing Amis, English, and Mandarin text to serve as parallel corpora for training MT systems for Amis, one of the Indigenous languages of Taiwan. To supplement the small amount of Amis-English data, we produce synthetic Amis-English data by using a high quality MT system to generate English translations for the Mandarin side of the Amis-Mandarin corpus. Using two popular neural MT systems, OpenNMT and NLLB, we train models to translate between English and Amis, and Mandarin and Amis. We find that including synthetic data is helpful only when translating to English. In addition, we observe that neither MT architecture is consistently superior to other and that performance seems to vary according to the direction of translation and the amount of data used. These results indicate that MT is possible for an under-resourced language even without a formally prepared parallel corpus, but multiple training methods should be explored to produce optimal results."
